If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start.

I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
                -- Litany Against Fear, Dune

The mind commands the body and is instantly obeyed. The mind commands itself
and meets resistance. The mind commands the hand to move, and it so easy that
one hardly distinguishes the order from its execution. Yet mind is mind and
hand is body. The mind orders the mind to will. The recipient of the order is
itself, yet it does not perform it.
                -- St. Augustine of Hippo, Confessions

Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must
awaken.
                -- Duke Leto Atreides, Dune
